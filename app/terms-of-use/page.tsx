        6. Domain Availability Terms
      </h3>
      <p className='pb-4'>
        <strong className='font-semibold text-purple-950'>'Registered'</strong>{' '}
        means the domain is taken by another person. However, it does not mean
        you can't get the domain. Maybe the person has purchased and listed the
        domain for sale. Since there are many listing platforms, we at
        SmartBrandly can't accurately trace that. If you see a domain is
        registered but you still want it, you can do a quick check on registrars
        like Namecheap or GoDaddy and see whether it is on sale.
      </p>
      <p className='pb-4'>
        <strong className='font-semibold text-purple-950'>'Reserved'</strong>{' '}
        means the domain is set aside for a specific purpose and is not
        available for registration.
      </p>
      <p className='pb-4'>
        <strong className='font-semibold text-purple-950'>'Available'</strong>{' '}
        means the domain is available to register. However, we have encountered
        instances where reserved domains are marked as available.
      </p>
      <p className='pb-4'>
        <strong className='font-semibold text-purple-950'>
          'No Data' or 'Unknown'
        </strong>{' '}
        means that our application tried to do the check but there was an error.
        It could be due to poor network connectivity, our servers being down, or
        an error occurring during the check.
      </p>
      <p className='pb-4'>
        <strong className='font-semibold text-purple-950'>'Pending'</strong>{' '}
        means the check is in progress. If this persists, there may be an issue,
        but the application hasn't stopped the check yet.
      </p>
      <p className='pb-4'>
        <strong className='font-semibold text-purple-950'>'Error'</strong> means
        the availability check failed. You'll see this more often with the '.ai'
        TLD. In such cases, you can try to manually check the domain's
        availability.
